# manim-3-4-7
This app will create a high quality .mp4 file with an animation of the shapes formed by points scattered across an n-pointed star. For more information, check the video https://youtu.be/oEN0o9ZGmOM.

In order to execute this code, you need to have Manim installed. Manim is a Python library created by 3Blue1Brown (https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) to make high quality animations for his videos. You can see how to install Manim on https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html. Once Manim is installed, all you need to do is download the files `3-4-7.py` and `manim.cfg` and place them on a folder on your computer. Then, run `manim <path-to-3-4-7.py> ShowMovingPoints` on the command prompt, type the parameters of the star and wait for the video to render (might take a couple of minutes). Then, the rendered video should appear on `file/media/videos/3-4-7/1080p60/ShowMovingPoints.mp4`, where `file` is the file in which `3-4-7.py` is located.

If you don't want to install Manim on your computer, you can still run it by pasting the code in a Jupyter notebook right after the magic command `%%manim -qh -v WARNING ShowMovingPoints`. More details on how to set up a Jupyter notebook is available at https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html.
